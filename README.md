Watch this project on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUzOcJD_i4A&t=992s 
This project explores world population by continents and countries. The data is scraped directly from the internet from 3 web pages (given below). We then load this data in power BI, clean and transform it in Power Query, then present our findings in an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## SOURCES:
You can download an excel file for this data from Github repository, or if you want to follow this video, the links are given below.

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER
#### KPIs:
- Total population
- Yearly population change
- Median age
- Urban population

#### Questions / Charts:
1: Population Density by Country:
Bar or column chart displaying the population density (people per square kilometer) for different countries.

2: Geographical Visualization:
Population by continent

3: Population by country:
Treemap representing total population  & world population share allocated to each continent.

4: Migrants Impact on Population:
Stacked column chart /line chart comparing the net migration effect on population growth
Results: - Migration does not show any influence on population growth

5: Median Age Distribution:
